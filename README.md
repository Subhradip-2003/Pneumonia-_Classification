## 🧠 Project Overview
Pneumonia is a serious respiratory condition and timely diagnosis can save lives.  
This project leverages machine learning models to automate the classification of chest X-ray images into:

- **Normal**  
- **Pneumonia (bacterial or viral)**  

The goal is to develop a **scalable and accessible diagnostic tool** for use in under-resourced medical environments.

---

## 💡 Motivation
Manual diagnosis using chest X-rays is time-consuming and prone to human error.  
In low-income regions, radiologists are often unavailable.  

This project aims to:
- Provide an **AI-assisted diagnostic tool**  
- Improve **speed and accuracy** of detection  
- Demonstrate the **power of ML in healthcare**
